# Simcoe AI application workflow overview
Simcoe AI is a complex, secure, cloud-hosted and AI-powered application that employs sophisticated algorithms to determine the closest talent match to a given initiative or job description contextually. Its world-class security implementation brings a lot of peace of mind when integrating it with other Human Resource and ATS applications.

## Simcoe AI is scalable
The application is at the user's disposal, and it scales out automatically on the cloud to harness more resources to process applicants' resumes. This demand-driven architecture lets the system match talents to the job description more rapidly and efficiently.

## Simcoe AI is a multi-user application
The application has been architectured and designed to accommodate a team of users at a company. The administrator who signed up on behalf of the company can easily add or remove team members to work collaboratively.

## Simcoe AI is secure
Simcoe AI has been integrated with Microsoft Azure Active Directory to operate as a secure entity. This integration ensures that the requests made to the backend are legit and authentic.

## Simco AI is event-driven
Simcoe AI's architecture is event-driven and it informs the users once the results are ready. Requests can be placed by a simple Web Api and the results are relayed back to the caller by web sockets asynchronously.

## Simcoe AI's lake of resumes
Resumes in any format like Microsoft Word, PDF or plain text are retained in "Lakes" where they can be searched based on the job descriptions stored in the system. Each team member can choose any lakes available in the company account to run their search campaign.

## Simcoe AI's interview
Users can design interviews and send them to the best matches (higher-ranked candidates) by email. An algorithm collects candidates' answers and combines them with search results to compute the final candidates' scores.
